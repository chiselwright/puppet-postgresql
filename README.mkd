## Tips

### Search path errors

If you get errors because you don't have a search path and you're using
non-absolute paths to executables, add the following to the top of your
sites.pp

    # http://groups.google.com/group/puppet-users/browse_thread/thread/c60e8ae314ae687b
    Exec {
        path => ["/bin", "/sbin", "/usr/bin", "/usr/sbin"],
    }
